This repository aims to be a central source for all possible information on the Game Genie. Pull requests are highly appreciated.

Until someone submits information pertaining to one of the other models of Game Genie, I'll be focusing on the NES model, as that is the one I own and have spent time studying.

I have invested dozens of hours at this point into studying the Game Genie; I hope this documentation can help people after me in their studies of it, and help to reduce duplicated work.
